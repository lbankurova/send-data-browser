# Engine Surface Coverage Matrix — Phase 2

> **Source plan:** `docs/_internal/incoming/scientific-defensibility-audit-plan.md` §2
> **Companion:** `.lattice/scientific-defensibility-findings.md` (Phase 1 SCIENCE-FLAGs)
> **Lives in parent** for the same reason as the findings file (submodule WIP). Migrate to `docs/_internal/research/distillations/engine-surface-coverage-2026-04-30.md` when the submodule clears.

This is a tier-by-tier inventory of the algorithmic outputs SENDEX produces, mapped to which validation-harness assertion type covers each surface. Cells:

- **GROUND_TRUTH** — covered by an equality matcher; engine call MUST equal the authored expectation
- **REGRESSION_PIN** — covered by description-only assertion (always-pass) OR by `zero_adverse`-style aggregate; surface drift not detected
- **UNCOVERED** — no validation-harness assertion checks this surface; engine output is asserted only by unit/integration tests in `backend/tests/`

Rows = surfaces (algorithmic decisions). Phase-3 candidates are the UNCOVERED rows where the surface meaningfully drives downstream consumption.

## Coverage summary (16 reference YAMLs, this audit)

| Tier | Surfaces in tier | GROUND_TRUTH | REGRESSION_PIN | UNCOVERED | Coverage % |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 (regulatory) | 11 | 5 | 1 | 5 | 45% |
| Tier 2 (narrative) | 13 | 3 | 0 | 10 | 23% |
| Tier 3 (input) | 13 | 0 | 3 | 10 | 0% (GT only) |
| Design | 6 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 100% |
| Provenance | 4 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0% |
| **Total** | **47** | **14** | **4** | **29** | **30%** GROUND_TRUTH |

Phase 1 closes the 16-study × ~5-surface authoring grid for Tier 1. Phase 2 confirms the long tail: **29 of 47 algorithmic surfaces have no harness coverage**, most concentrated in Tier 2 (severity, syndromes, recovery) and Tier 3 (HCD, outliers, onset, monotonicity).

## Phase 3 priority candidates (per audit plan §3)

Ordered by regulatory-leverage × Phase-1-flag-relevance:

1. **`class_distribution` matcher** — encodes per-study finding-class breakdowns (`>=N tr_adverse, >=M equivocal, etc.`). Direct measurement of the over-classification gap surfaced as Study2/4 + TOXSCI-87497 SCIENCE-FLAGs. Highest value.
2. **`severity_distribution` matcher** — encodes max severity grade per organ system. Tier 2 anchor; complements target_organs_flagged.
3. ~~**`recovery_verdict` matcher**~~ — DONE 2026-04-30 (AUDIT-5). Reads `recovery_verdicts.json:per_subject` joined with `subject_context.json:DOSE_GROUP_ORDER`. PointCross authored: MED hepatic hypertrophy MATCH (anomaly>=10, regression guard for engine's correct emergence detection) + HIGH hepatic hypertrophy SCIENCE-FLAG (persistent>=10 expected, engine reports anomaly=10 — Stream 4 NEW: per-subject `main_severity=null` schema mismatch with cohort aggregate at HIGH which shows 9/10 affected at sev 2.56). 4 other recovery-bearing studies (TOXSCI-35449, instem, PDS, Study4) per-study authoring deferred (AUDIT-17).
4. **`tumor_detected` matcher** — PointCross hepatic adenoma + carcinoma, plus any tumor-bearing TOXSCI study. Tier 2.
5. **`hcd_score` matcher** — within-HCD verdict; only fires on cyno + rat HCD-eligible tests. Tier 3 input layer; complements knowledge-graph parity tests.
6. ~~**`compound_class_flag` matcher**~~ — DONE 2026-04-30 (AUDIT-7). Reads `pk_integration.json:compound_class`. PointCross MATCH (small_molecule baseline) + Study1/2/3/4 SCIENCE-FLAG (engine has no vaccine/gene_therapy classifier in `services/analysis/compound_class.py:484-543`). 4 new flags reinforce Stream 1 at the source rather than via downstream class_distribution proxy.
7. **`onset_concordance` matcher** — multi-timepoint studies; encodes when LOAEL is reached.
8. **Sex-specific NOAEL/LOAEL extension** — `expected_value_male`, `expected_value_female`. Lightweight extension of existing matchers; addresses TOXSCI-43066 sex-divergent NOAEL.
9. ~~**`cross_organ_syndrome` matcher**~~ — DONE 2026-04-30 (AUDIT-10). Reads `syndrome_rollup.json:cross_organ_syndromes`. PointCross SCIENCE-FLAG (7-organ co-firing pattern invisible to engine's `len(organs) > 1` definition-spanning gate -- Stream 5 NEW: cross-organ co-firing not captured) + instem MATCH (`phospholipidosis` n=7) + TOXSCI-96298 MATCH (`phospholipidosis` n=32). Matcher supports 3 modes: equality (id+organs+min_count), count-floor (min_count alone), absence (max_count: 0). The original "Hy's-Law-style" framing was misleading -- the engine surface is "syndromes whose definition spans multiple organs" (currently only phospholipidosis qualifies), not "study-level multi-organ co-firing." Per-study expansion (other 12 zero-emit studies + corpus-wide co-firing assessment) deferred to AUDIT-20.

Each is a Phase-1-style author-and-encode pass plus a matcher implementation. Per the audit plan: ~1-2 hours per matcher + ~30 min per study × ~16 = ~10-20 hours total for Tier 2/3.

## Anti-goals (explicitly out of Phase 2 scope)

- **Validation-conformance surfaces** (`validation_results.json` core CDISC checks) are NOT algorithmic outputs in the SENDEX sense; they're SEND-format conformance. Out of scope.
- **`unrecognized_terms.json`** is dictionary-versioning telemetry, not algorithmic output. Out of scope.
- **Subject-similarity linkage matrices** are visualization-time computations; not regulatory-driving.

These are excluded from the Phase 3 candidate list because they don't support an authored GROUND_TRUTH ("what would a toxicologist conclude?") — they're either format checks or rendering helpers.
