    "VALIDATION CAVEAT: MedDRA is proprietary and the full dictionary is only available to licensed subscribers (MSSO). This mapping was constructed from publicly available fragments — BioPortal, CTCAE v5.0 crosswalks, MedDRA Introductory Guides, pharmacovigilance literature, and MedDRA naming conventions. Common PTs (e.g. Hepatomegaly, Blood glucose increased) are high-confidence (~90%+). The 17 entries flagged with _note metadata are medium/lower confidence (~50-70%) where PTs were inferred from naming patterns rather than confirmed in a licensed browser. Before wiring into production concordance scoring, spot-check all PTs against a licensed MedDRA v27.0 distribution: search each PT string, confirm it exists as a PT (not just an LLT), and verify the primary SOC assignment.",
    "PT and SOC strings should be validated against your licensed MedDRA v27.0 distribution.",
    "Lab test keys are SEND LBTESTCD codes per NCI EVS C65047.",
    "Histopathology keys are MI-qualified as MI:<FINDING>:<ORGAN>.",
    "Organ weights are OM-qualified as OM:WEIGHT:<ORGAN>:UP|DOWN.",
    "Entries with '_note' fields contain verification guidance for PTs with medium or lower confidence.",
    "Novel renal biomarker PTs (KIM1, NGAL, NAG) may only exist in MedDRA v24.0+; verify in licensed browser.",
    "Electrolyte and hormone Investigation PTs follow MedDRA's 'Blood [analyte] [qualifier]' convention.",
    "MedDRA uses British/INN spellings throughout (e.g., 'oestradiol', 'haemoglobin', 'anaemia').",
    "OM Investigation PTs use generic 'Organ weight increased/decreased' — organ-specific weight PTs (e.g. 'Liver weight increased') may only exist as LLTs in MedDRA.",
    "All terms use MedDRA British/INN spellings: anaemia (not anemia), oedema (not edema), haemorrhage (not hemorrhage), oestradiol (not estradiol)."
