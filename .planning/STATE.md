# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-05)

**Core value:** Automated toxicological signal detection and evidence synthesis
**Current focus:** Exploratory development (~60% through current phase)

## Active Workstreams

Work proceeds in parallel across low-conflict areas. Priorities are user-directed based on UI testing.

| Workstream | Status | Key Files | Notes |
|------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| UI Restructuring | In progress | Various view components | View rewrites, new UI elements |
| Engine Fixes | In progress | `services/analysis/`, `lib/` | Bugs found during testing |
| Test Coverage | In progress | `frontend/tests/`, `backend/tests/` | Expanding vitest + pytest |
| Missing Features | Queued | See TODO.md (MF-03, MF-05, MF-09) | Rail indicator, validation rules |
| Bug Fixes | Queued | See TODO.md (BUG-06, BUG-07) | Column resize, dumbbell chart |

## Recently Completed

See `docs/TODO-archived.md` for full history (40 resolved items).

Notable recent:
- Recovery audit fixes 1-5 (all committed + tested)
- Extracted `_compute_incidence_recovery()` to `services/analysis/incidence_recovery.py`
- 44 new tests (22 backend, 22 frontend) covering all 5 audit fixes
- Spec archived: `docs/incoming/archive/recovery-assessment-audit.md`
- GAP-59 logged: recovery sex-stratification investigation (P1)

## Backlog

Single source of truth: `docs/TODO.md` (74 open items)

## Context for Agents

- Read `docs/TODO.md` at session start
- Check `docs/knowledge/methods-index.md` and `field-contracts-index.md` before writing new logic (CLAUDE.md rule 6)
- Doc lifecycle (CLAUDE.md rule 7): system specs in `docs/systems/` — create if missing when touching a subsystem
- Design system changes require explicit user approval (CLAUDE.md rule 1)
- Run commit checklist before every commit

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-03-09
Stopped at: BUG-17 fix committed (f9f3440) — domain-aware effect size labels across 9 files.
Uncommitted work: 8 files — annotation system (audit_log, override_reader, annotations router), pattern/onset dose dropdown refactors, MortalityDataSettings, useAnnotations, annotations-api. These are from a prior session and were not committed.
Next action: Pick from TODO.md. Mark BUG-17 as resolved. Consider committing the 8 uncommitted files (review first — they may be WIP).
