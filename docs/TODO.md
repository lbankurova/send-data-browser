## Agent Protocol

**Every agent reads this file at session start.** When you finish a task:
1. Check this file for the next open item relevant to your role
2. Suggest it to the user as the next action
3. If you discover new issues during your work, add them here with: category, ID (next in sequence), description, affected files, and suggested owner role

**Role ownership hints:**
- `BUG`, `SD`, `RED` items touching frontend → **frontend-dev** or **ux-designer**
- `BUG`, `HC`, `MF`, `GAP` items touching backend → **backend-dev**
- `GAP-11`, `GAP-12`, `RED` items (design) → **ux-designer**

## Bugs (1 open)

### BUG-06: Histopath findings table column resize not working
- **Files:** `frontend/src/components/analysis/HistopathologyView.tsx` (`OverviewTab` component)
- **Issue:** The observed findings table uses TanStack React Table with `enableColumnResizing: true` and `tableLayout: "fixed"`, but drag-to-resize on column headers does not work. The resize handle div (`.cursor-col-resize`) is present and highlights on hover, but dragging produces no visible column width change. Likely a conflict between `tableLayout: "fixed"` with percentage-free `width` styles and the TanStack resize state, or the `onClick` sort handler on `<th>` interfering with `onMouseDown` on the resize child. The severity matrix table in the same view uses the identical pattern and works — compare the two to find the difference.
- **Status:** Open
- **Owner hint:** frontend-dev

## Hardcoded Values (8 open)

### HC-01: Dose group mapping
- **Files:** `backend/services/analysis/dose_groups.py:10`
- **Issue:** `ARMCD_TO_DOSE_LEVEL = {"1": 0, "2": 1, "3": 2, "4": 3}`. Only works for PointCross.
- **Fix:** Derive dynamically from TX/DM domains.
- **Status:** Open

### HC-02: Recovery arm codes
- **Files:** `backend/services/analysis/dose_groups.py:13`
- **Issue:** `RECOVERY_ARMCDS = {"1R", "2R", "3R", "4R"}` hardcoded.
- **Fix:** Derive from TX domain (TXPARMCD = "RECOVDUR").
- **Status:** Open

### HC-03: Single-study restriction
- **Files:** `backend/config.py:15`
- **Issue:** `ALLOWED_STUDIES = {"PointCross"}` restricts entire app.
- **Status:** Open (blocked on multi-study support)

### HC-04: File-based annotation storage
- **Files:** `backend/routers/annotations.py`
- **Issue:** JSON files on disk, no transactions, no concurrency.
- **Fix:** Replace with database. API contract is storage-agnostic — zero frontend changes.
- **Status:** Open (blocked on database infrastructure)

### HC-05: Hardcoded reviewer identity
- **Files:** `backend/routers/annotations.py:56`
- **Issue:** `reviewedBy` always set to `"User"`. Blocked on auth.
- **Status:** Open (blocked on auth)

### HC-06: No authentication
- **Files:** `backend/main.py:36-41`
- **Issue:** CORS `allow_origins=["*"]`, no auth middleware.
- **Status:** Open (infrastructure dependency)

### HC-07: Non-PointCross demo guard
- **Files:** `frontend/src/components/panels/ContextPanel.tsx:399`
- **Issue:** Shows "demo entry" message for any non-PointCross study.
- **Status:** Open (blocked on HC-03)

### HC-09: Review Progress pane counts depend on file-based annotations
- **Files:** `frontend/src/components/panels/ContextPanel.tsx` (StudyInspector)
- **Issue:** Client-side `Object.keys()` counting on annotation objects. Won't scale to multi-user.
- **Fix:** Add dedicated API endpoint when HC-04 is implemented.
- **Status:** Open (blocked on HC-04)

## Spec Divergences (2 open)

### SD-08: FW domain asymmetry
- **Issue:** FW only in generator pipeline, not in on-demand adverse effects pipeline. Low priority — FW rarely drives adversity.
- **Status:** Open

### SD-10: SelectionContext duplication
- **Issue:** `SelectionContext` tracks landing page study selection but is unused once inside a study route (route params take over). Remove the redundancy.
- **Status:** Open

## Missing Features (4 open)

### MF-03: Validation rules SEND-VAL-016, SEND-VAL-018
- **Issue:** Visit day alignment (016) and domain-specific findings checks (018) not defined in YAML.
- **Status:** Not implemented

### MF-04: CDISC Library integration
- **Issue:** CT metadata compiled from public docs, not from official CDISC Library API.
- **Status:** Defer to production

### MF-05: Write-back capability for fix scripts
- **Issue:** Fix scripts only annotate; production needs correction overlay (not XPT modification).
- **Status:** Defer to production

### ~~MF-06: Recovery arm analysis~~ ✅
- **Issue:** Recovery subjects excluded from all computations. Separate analysis mode needed.
- **Status:** Resolved (commits 4f6138f, 4181435, e51c67f) — phase-aware pooling (DATA-01), recovery toggle, 62 tests

### MF-08: No authentication system
- **Issue:** No auth anywhere. Required for production.
- **Status:** Infrastructure dependency

## Gaps (11 open)

### GAP-01: No URL persistence of filter state
- **Status:** Skip for prototype (Datagrok handles differently)

### GAP-02: No deep linking
- **Status:** Skip for prototype (same rationale as GAP-01)

### GAP-04: No concurrency control on annotations
- **Status:** Skip for prototype (single-user)

### GAP-05: No audit trail for annotations
- **Status:** Skip for prototype (P1 for production — GLP requires change traceability)

### GAP-07: SENDIG metadata not verified
- **Status:** Defer until CDISC Library integration (MF-04)

### GAP-08: No incremental recomputation
- **Status:** Skip for prototype (pipeline runs in ~2s)

### GAP-09: SPECIMEN CT check commented out
- **Status:** Defer until CDISC Library integration (MF-04)

### GAP-11/12: Hypotheses tab intent icons and workflow design
- **Files:** `frontend/src/components/analysis/DoseResponseView.tsx`
- **Issue:** Intent icons are placeholder choices (GAP-11). Intents are analytical workflows, not viewer types — need design task before code (GAP-12). Current placeholder implementation sufficient for prototype.
- **Status:** Open (design task, defer to production)

### GAP-14: Design tokens for icons
- **Files:** `frontend/src/lib/design-tokens.ts`, `frontend/src/index.css`, various components
- **Issue:** No centralized icon tokens (size, stroke width, color by context). Icon sizes and colors are ad-hoc across components. Need standardized tokens like `icon.sm` / `icon.md` / `icon.lg` with contextual color rules (muted in chrome, primary in actions, etc.) aligned with Datagrok UI Kit.
- **Status:** Open
- **Owner hint:** ux-designer → frontend-dev

### GAP-15: Organ rail click-to-deselect
- **Files:** `frontend/src/components/analysis/StudySummaryView.tsx`
- **Issue:** Clicking the already-selected organ in the Signals rail does not deselect it (I-02 checklist rule). Currently moot because auto-select would immediately re-select. If auto-select behavior changes, this should be revisited.
- **Status:** Open (deferred — no user impact with current auto-select)
- **Owner hint:** frontend-dev

### GAP-13: Generated HTML report needs redesign
- **Files:** `frontend/src/lib/report-generator.ts`
- **Issue:** Report built before views were fully designed. Needs redesign to reflect current view structure and user workflows.
- **Status:** Open (blocked on user flow document)

### GAP-16: Compound-class contextual warnings (REM-20 deferred)
- **Files:** `frontend/src/lib/syndrome-interpretation.ts`
- **Issue:** REM-20 originally called for explicit missing-domain warnings and compound-class context. The missing-domain warnings were implemented as part of REM-15 (data sufficiency gate, METH-29). The compound-class comparison aspect — warning when a syndrome is detected for a compound whose pharmacological class has known organ-specific effects — requires an external reference database mapping compound classes to expected finding profiles. This database does not currently exist in the system. When available, it would enable contextual warnings like "XS01 detected; compound class (NSAID) has known hepatotoxicity — consider class effect vs. novel finding."
- **Blocked on:** External compound-class-to-findings reference database
- **Status:** Open (deferred — no data source available)
- **Owner hint:** backend-dev (database), frontend-dev (integration into interpretation layer)

### ~~GAP-18: Auto-select organ weight method — full spec implementation~~
- **Files:** `frontend/src/lib/organ-weight-normalization.ts` (NEW), `frontend/src/hooks/useOrganWeightNormalization.ts` (NEW), `frontend/src/components/analysis/StudySummaryView.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/analysis/panes/StudyDetailsContextPanel.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/analysis/panes/OrganContextPanel.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/analysis/panes/FindingsContextPanel.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/analysis/panes/SyndromeContextPanel.tsx`, `frontend/src/lib/cross-domain-syndromes.ts`, `frontend/src/lib/syndrome-interpretation.ts`
- **Resolution:** Phase 1 of Organ Weight Normalization Auto-Selection Engine implemented. Hedges' g decision engine with 4-tier BW confounding classification, species/strain profiles (12 entries), Bailey et al. organ correlation categories (21 entries), full UI integration (Study Details view + Findings view context panels), syndrome engine integration (OM term annotation + B-7 secondary-to-BW adversity factor). 55 unit tests. Phase 2 (ANCOVA backend) and Phase 3 (Bayesian mediation) deferred.
- **Status:** ~~Resolved~~ (Phase 1 complete)
- **Owner hint:** ux-designer → frontend-dev

### GAP-17: Chrome MCP server for E2E / integration testing
- **Files:** N/A (new infrastructure)
- **Issue:** Pure-function unit tests cannot catch UI wiring bugs (e.g., a dropdown writes to session state but a derived override prevents the displayed value from updating — see Bonferroni dropdown bug fixed 2026-02-23). An MCP server for Chrome would enable Claude Code to drive browser interactions and verify visual/interactive behavior as part of the development loop. This would cover the gap between vitest unit tests and full Playwright E2E suites.
- **Approach:** Implement an MCP server that exposes Chrome DevTools Protocol actions (navigate, click, read DOM, screenshot). Claude Code connects via MCP tool, enabling ad-hoc integration checks during development without heavyweight E2E infrastructure.
- **Status:** Open (not critical — unit tests cover math; this catches wiring/interaction bugs)
- **Owner hint:** infrastructure
